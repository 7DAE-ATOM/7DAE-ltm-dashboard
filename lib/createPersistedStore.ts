/**
 * The one implementation of "a user preference, kept in browser storage, read
 * by React through `useSyncExternalStore`".
 *
 * Every preference store in `lib/` used to carry its own copy of this
 * plumbing — module state, hydration flag, listener set, `emit`, `subscribe`,
 * `getSnapshot`, `getServerSnapshot`, the `try/catch` around persistence. Each
 * copy meant one more place to hold the same invariants right, and the
 * cross-tab `storage` listener was missing from all of them.
 *
 * What this factory owns:
 *  - **Lazy hydration** — storage is read on the first subscribe or read, never
 *    at import time, so importing the module stays free of side effects
 *    (including on the server).
 *  - **A constant server snapshot** — always the same `defaultValue` reference,
 *    so the server render and the first client paint agree.
 *  - **Snapshot identity** — a new reference is minted only on a real write.
 *    `useSyncExternalStore` compares snapshots by identity, so a fresh object
 *    per read loops forever; holding that invariant here is the point.
 *  - **Forgiving persistence** — unavailable storage (private mode), a corrupt
 *    value or an exceeded quota never throw: the value still applies in memory
 *    and subscribers are still notified.
 *  - **Cross-tab sync** — one `storage` listener per store, installed on the
 *    first subscriber and released with the last.
 *
 * What it deliberately leaves to each caller: the `parse` function. That is
 * where a preference's real validation lives (clamping a size, checking a
 * field at a time, filtering against a list of known keys), and it must stay
 * explicit rather than collapse into a blind `JSON.parse`.
 *
 * A preference belongs here unless it must be correct *before* hydration or be
 * readable by CSS — those two (`lib/useTheme.ts`, `lib/catalogueDensity.ts`)
 * keep the DOM as their source of truth. See CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * The three older stores (`lib/radarDisplaySettings.ts`,
 * `lib/photoCacheSettings.ts`, `lib/interactionDisplaySettings.ts`) still
 * hand-roll the pattern. Migrating them is mechanical and deliberately left
 * out of the change that introduced this file.
