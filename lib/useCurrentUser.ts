/**
 * Loads the identity (login, email, names…) of the user viewing the page.
 *
 * The SPA never sees the JWT itself — the AFTER gateway injects it on the
 * request to the backend — so the backend decodes it and returns the claims
 * through `GET /api/infos/me`.
 *
 * The error is **returned, never thrown** — same reasoning as
 * `getAircraftTree`: who is logged in is cosmetic, and a failure must not
 * replace the page with the `app/error.tsx` screen. In dev without
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_JWT` the call answers 401, so `user` simply stays `null`.
 *
 * The identity cannot change while the page is open, so revalidation is off:
 * one request per page load, shared by every caller through the SWR cache.
 *
 * Personal data: it lives in the SWR memory cache only — never written to
 * localStorage / sessionStorage, never logged.
